       "Our Swayam Gram website helps to solve problems occured in villages. If there's something wrong, like a broken bridge, broken roads or a health issue, villagers can use the website to tell authorities about it. They can explain the problem and even take pictures to show exactly what's wrong. The website also shows where the problem is on a map, so authorities can find it easily. Problems are sorted into categories, like fixing things or health concerns, to help decide what to fix first. Once a problem is reported, the website tells the right people to fix it, and they can keep villagers updated on what's being done. Everyone in the village can work together through the website to solve problems and make their community better. It's like a teamwork tool that makes fixing things faster and easier."
